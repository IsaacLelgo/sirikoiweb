            <p>Beads vary in material (bone, glass, horn, seeds, shells, stones and fossilized materials), their significance, colour, size, and placement on the body or clothing. All these denote and evoke different meanings in different tribes. In most tribes, beads embody beauty, tradition, culture, strength, marital status, age, power, and warrior-hood.</p>
            <p>Each colour bead represents a specific and significant aspect of their culture; however, these may vary from tribe to tribe.</p>

            <h2>The Story of the Beads</h2>
            <p>The Maasai, Samburu, Turkana, and Rendille pastoral tribes are highly associated with beadwork in Kenya. They are known for their elaborate beaded jewelry, red-painted chins with ochre, headdresses, stacked bracelets, and heavy brass earrings.</p>
            <p>The women in these tribes wear these pieces as a sign of wealth, marital status, health, and to denote the number of children they have. For instance, if a woman's first child is a boy, she wears many earrings. This also applies to women with several male children. Similarly, traditional wedding collars have several beaded strands hanging from them, which represent the amount of dowry paid for that bride, typically in the form of cattle.</p>
            <p>Women wear these pieces as a sign of beauty and wealth, while men wear beaded pieces and different symbols on their bodies to mark their achievements. For instance, young Maasai warriors wear an arm band, known as the "errap," made of leather and metal wire coils, indicating that he has fought and killed another man.</p>
            <p>To girls, a crimson collar of beads is given by their father to signify that a husband has already been chosen for her, but she is not yet engaged. Once engaged, the crimson collar is traded for brass earrings, marking the transition to marriage.</p>
